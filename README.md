Hey there, Welcome! I'm glad you're here. My name is Rajib Das and I'm a Software Engineer.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer @ Nexily where I typically build things with JavaScript/TypeScript. I've been also sharing educational lessons on various software engineering concepts and tools as I learn them. I'm absolutely positive you'll love the way I articulate them and find them useful. You can find them all in here: [![Linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=flat-square&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajuzest/). Looking forward to getting to know you.

If you have a moment, allow me to add a little background about myself:

I studied computer science at university but I was never into taking it seriously until shortly before my penultimate year. At that time, I was on a quest to become useful. And for that, I started getting a feel for “how to code” and thankfully, it didn’t take too long to become obsessed with it.

I tried to attempt my programming experience with C/C++ but sooner I was introduced with a great teacher, Mr. Jonas Schemedtman, which pivoted my game plan by and large. His wonderful teaching skills made me fall in love with JavaScript and programming in general.

Circling back to that time bring one important realization - there was too many list of programming topics feels foreign to me and still does but with time it’s getting easier to deal with.

These are the topics, I’m aiming to educate myself:

- Database, Scaling Backend Services, REST APIs Design
- Data Structures, Algorithms
- Pointers, OOP Design, Functional Paradigm
- UI side of things: State Management, Core Web Vitals, Different Rendering Trade-offs

Commitment of the above deepening my relationships with these languages:

- PostgreSQL + Nest JS
- JavaScript / TypeScript + CPP
- CSS with the focus of tinkering it with modern JS context (Tailwind, Styled Components)
- React JS + Next JS + React Query + Redux
