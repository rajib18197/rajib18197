Hi, I'm Rajib! I'm currently working as a Software Engineer @ Nexily where I typically build things with JavaScript/TypeScript.

ðŸŒ± I Invest time and energy mostly on educating myself:
- Database intricacies, REST APIs development, 
- Data structures, Algorithms,
- Pointers, OOP Design,
- Functional Paradigm, State Management, 
- Spring Animation, Styling web apps & Accessible UI
- feature rich and dynamic web apps

ðŸ“š Commitment of the above deepening my relationships with these languages:
- PostgreSQL + MongoDB
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- CSS, with the focus of tinkering it with modern JS context (Tailwind, Styled Components)
- React JS + Next JS
- React Query + Redux + Framer Motion + animations with CSS & JS
- Express JS

Though Iâ€™m not working with C/C++, Java in my day-to-day job but to understand Pointers, OOP and other low level things better I went through the learning materials of these languages quite a bit on my initial days and constantly try to keep in touch with them for betterment.
